26,Sachin,"They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child."
27,Sachin,Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East).
28,Sachin,"As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school."
29,Sachin,"He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe."
30,Sachin,"To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984."
31,Sachin,"He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar."
32,Sachin,"In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best."
33,Sachin,"Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game."
34,Sachin,"Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree."
35,Sachin,"This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy."
36,Sachin,"Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers."
37,Sachin,"Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East)."
38,Sachin,He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.
39,Sachin,Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets.
40,Sachin,"If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin."
41,Sachin,"If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin."
42,Sachin,Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.

46,Sachin,Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.
47,Sachin,"Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League, and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India."
48,Sachin,"In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead."
49,Sachin,"On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India."
50,Sachin,"A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's ""Best junior cricket award"" (He was 14 years that time)."
51,Sachin,"""It was the greatest source of encouragement for me,"" Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries."
52,Sachin,Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.
53,Sachin,"In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played."
54,Sachin,"He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India."
55,Sachin,The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game.
56,Sachin,Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.
57,Sachin,"This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India."
58,Sachin,"On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season."
59,Sachin,"However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder."
60,Sachin,"He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup."
61,Sachin,"A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket."
62,Sachin,"He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets, where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team."
63,Sachin,"He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments."
64,Sachin,Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer.
65,Sachin,"He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall."
66,Sachin,"He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India."
67,Sachin,"Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989."
68,Sachin,"In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day."
69,Sachin,His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.
70,Sachin,"He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies)."
71,Sachin,"Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career."
72,Sachin,"In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties."
73,Sachin,"Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52."
74,Sachin,"Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989, after one first class season."
75,Sachin,"The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career."
76,Sachin,Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days.
77,Sachin,"He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack."
78,Sachin,"In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it."
79,Sachin,"In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir."
80,Sachin,"This was later called ""one of the best innings I have seen"" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth."
81,Sachin,"In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played."
82,Sachin,Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.
83,Sachin,The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.
84,Sachin,"He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other."
85,Sachin,"On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match."
86,Sachin,"Wisden described his innings as ""a disciplined display of immense maturity"" and also wrote:"
87,Sachin,"He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads."
88,Sachin,"While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot."
89,Sachin,"Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen."
90,Sachin,"Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia."
91,Sachin,"He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott."
92,Sachin,"Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that ""This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."""
93,Sachin,"Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties."
94,Sachin,"He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls."
95,Sachin,He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.
96,Sachin,It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
97,Sachin,"Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries."
98,Sachin,He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka.
99,Sachin,"Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field."
100,Sachin,"After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch."
101,Sachin,Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket.
102,Sachin,"After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat."
103,Sachin,Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.
104,Sachin,India went on to win that match.
105,Sachin,It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.
106,Sachin,"This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries."
107,Sachin,"The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series."
108,Sachin,"In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne."
109,Sachin,"In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match."
110,Sachin,Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.
111,Sachin,"He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi."
112,Sachin,"Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs."
113,Sachin,"The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia."
114,Sachin,These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.
115,Sachin,"Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis."
116,Sachin,"Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls."
117,Sachin,"The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka."
118,Sachin,"In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar."
119,Sachin,"Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record."
120,Sachin,"The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field."
121,Sachin,"The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people."
122,Sachin,Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.
123,Sachin,"India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan."
124,Sachin,"In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory."
125,Sachin,"However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs."
126,Sachin,"The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup."
127,Sachin,"Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe."
128,Sachin,"However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol."
129,Sachin,He dedicated this century to his father.
130,Sachin,Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful.
131,Sachin,"When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations."
132,Sachin,"However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly."
133,Sachin,"Azharuddin was credited with saying ""Nahin jeetega!"
134,Sachin,Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!
135,Sachin,""", which translates into: ""He won't win!"
136,Sachin,It's not in the small one's destiny!
137,Sachin,"Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions."
138,Sachin,"Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award as well as player of the match in one of the games."
139,Sachin,"After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000."
140,Sachin,"During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known."
141,Sachin,"The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins."
142,Sachin,"Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain."
143,Sachin,"In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team."
144,Sachin,Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering.
145,Sachin,Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.
146,Sachin,"This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball."
147,Sachin,Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.
148,Sachin,"The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism, and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match."
149,Sachin,The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.
150,Sachin,The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.
151,Sachin,"Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball."
152,Sachin,Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001.
153,Sachin,"Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test."
154,Sachin,He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.
155,Sachin,This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.
156,Sachin,"In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa."
157,Sachin,"In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test."
158,Sachin,"In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds."
159,Sachin,"He was awarded by Sports car ""Ferrari"" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat."
160,Sachin,"Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings."
161,Sachin,"He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century."
162,Sachin,"However, India lost the series."
163,Sachin,"In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match."
164,Sachin,"Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, helping India reach the final."
165,Sachin,"While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award."
166,Sachin,"He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia."
167,Sachin,"As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final."
168,Sachin,"The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position."
169,Sachin,He spend 613 minute at crease.
170,Sachin,India have a first inning score of 705/7.
171,Sachin,He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.
172,Sachin,"Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests."
173,Sachin,"It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty."
174,Sachin,Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series.
175,Sachin,Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.
176,Sachin,Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.
177,Sachin,Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.
178,Sachin,"After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest."
179,Sachin,"A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004."
180,Sachin,"He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1."
181,Sachin,"On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans."
182,Sachin,"After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007."
183,Sachin,Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.
184,Sachin,"He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory."
185,Sachin,"On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd, the first time that he had ever faced such flak."
186,Sachin,"Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity."
187,Sachin,Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine.
188,Sachin,"In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century."
189,Sachin,"Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method."
190,Sachin,"During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell."
191,Sachin,"Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career."

274,Sachin,India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.
275,Sachin,"Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that ""Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life."

277,Sachin,"
India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate."
278,Sachin,He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.
279,Sachin,Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined).
280,Sachin,However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No.
281,Sachin,1 ranked Test side.
282,Sachin,The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.
283,Sachin,"Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi."
284,Sachin,"For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC."
285,Sachin,Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia.
286,Sachin,He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.
287,Sachin,Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.
288,Sachin,"Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long."
289,Sachin,The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.
290,Sachin,"Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup."
291,Sachin,"He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh."
292,Sachin,"He said ""It's been a tough phase for me ..."
293,Sachin,"I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred."
294,Sachin,Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds.
295,Sachin,"It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."""
296,Sachin,"Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets."
297,Sachin,"After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home, in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012."
298,Sachin,This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009.
299,Sachin,"He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one."
300,Sachin,"However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012, some people have started to question his place in the Indian team."
301,Sachin,"A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs."
302,Sachin,"This speculation, however, was later considered to be false."
303,Sachin,Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy.
304,Sachin,"He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium."
305,Sachin,Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.
306,Sachin,"In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70), and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays."
307,Sachin,"In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer."
308,Sachin,Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.
309,Sachin,"He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526."
310,Sachin,"This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds."
311,Sachin,"Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket."
312,Sachin,"In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be ""tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it"", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar ""changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994""."
313,Sachin,"After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again."

317,Sachin,"At his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches be played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell would happen at his home ground."
318,Sachin,"He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli."
319,Sachin,The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.
320,Sachin,"Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today."

322,Sachin,"In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event."
323,Sachin,It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.
324,Sachin,So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).

333,Sachin,Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.
334,Sachin,Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league.
335,Sachin,He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana.
336,Sachin,But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches.
337,Sachin,Tendulkar scored 135 runs.
338,Sachin,"In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred."
339,Sachin,He scored 100 not out off 66 balls.
340,Sachin,"In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and in 2014 he was appointed as the Mumbai Indian's 'Team Icon'."

final of the 2013 Champions League, where he scored 14 runs in an Indians victory."
342,Sachin,"In his 78 matches in the IPL, Tendulkar scored a total of 2,334 runs; at the time of his retirement he was the fifth-highest run-scorer in the competition's history."
343,Sachin,"Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand."
344,Sachin,He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis.
345,Sachin,"Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the ""most wholesome batsman of his time""."
346,Sachin,His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes.
347,Sachin,"He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia."
348,Sachin,He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square.
349,Sachin,"He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through."
350,Sachin,The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.
351,Sachin,"In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that ""it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does""."
352,Sachin,"Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman."
353,Sachin,"Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his."
354,Sachin,"In his biography, it is stated that ""Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him."
355,Sachin,"Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."""
356,Sachin,Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.
357,Sachin,Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.
358,Sachin,He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004.
359,Sachin,Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking.
360,Sachin,"Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility."
361,Sachin,"During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball."
362,Sachin,"Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that ""Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke""."
363,Sachin,"Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years."
364,Sachin,He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.
365,Sachin,"While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin."
366,Sachin,"He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker."
367,Sachin,"With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion."
368,Sachin,"He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals."
369,Sachin,"Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries."
370,Sachin,"One of the most popular sayings by his fans is ""Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God""."
371,Sachin,"Cricinfo mentions in his profile that ""... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."""
372,Sachin,"During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said ""I have seen God."
373,Sachin,He bats at no.
374,Sachin,"4 in India in Tests."""
375,Sachin,"However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said ""I am not God of cricket."
376,Sachin,"I make mistakes, God doesn't."""
377,Sachin,"Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself."
378,Sachin,There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game.
379,Sachin,"As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century."
380,Sachin,"At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle."
381,Sachin,"Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to ""wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night""."
382,Sachin,"In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence."
383,Sachin,"Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010."
384,Sachin,"Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs."
385,Sachin,"He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals)."
386,Sachin,"He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20)."

388,Sachin,"In 2012, Tendulkar was ranked number 8 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian."

444,Sachin,The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:
445,Amitabh,"Amitabh Bachchan (pronounced ; born Inquilaab Srivastava; 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback singer and former politician."
446,Amitabh,"He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar and Sholay, and was dubbed India's ""angry young man"" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood."
447,Amitabh,"Referred to as the Shahenshah of Bollywood, Sadi ka Mahanayak (Hindi for, ""Greatest actor of the century""), Star of the Millennium, or Big B, he has since appeared in over 200 Indian films in a career spanning more than five decades."
448,Amitabh,Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema as well as world cinema.
449,Amitabh,"So total was his dominance on the Indian movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director François Truffaut called him a ""one-man industry""."
450,Amitabh,"Beyond the Indian subcontinent, he also has a large overseas following in markets including Africa (such as South Africa), the Middle East (especially Egypt), United Kingdom, Russia and parts of the United States."
451,Amitabh,"Bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including four National Film Awards as Best Actor, Dadasaheb Phalke Award as lifetime achievement award and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies."
452,Amitabh,"He has won fifteen Filmfare Awards and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 41 nominations overall."
453,Amitabh,"In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter."
454,Amitabh,"He has hosted several seasons of the game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, India's version of the game show franchise, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?."
455,Amitabh,He also entered politics for a time in the 1980s.
456,Amitabh,"The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts."
457,Amitabh,"The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the Legion of Honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond."
458,Amitabh,"Bachchan also made an appearance in a Hollywood film, Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby (2013), in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim."
459,Amitabh,Bachchan was born in Allahabad.
460,Amitabh,"His ancestors on his father's side came from a village called Babupatti, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the Pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, in India."
461,Amitabh,"His mother, Teji Bachchan, was a social activist and Punjabi Sikh woman from Lyallpur, Punjab, British India (present-day Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan)."
462,Amitabh,His father Harivansh Rai Bachchan was an Awadhi Hindu of Kayastha caste.
463,Amitabh,"His father was a poet, who was fluent in Awadhi and Urdu."
464,Amitabh,"Bachchan was initially named Inquilaab, inspired by the phrase Inquilab Zindabad (which translates into English as ""Long live the revolution"") popularly used during the Indian independence struggle."
465,Amitabh,"However, at the suggestion of fellow poet Sumitranandan Pant, Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which, according to a The Times of India article, means ""the light that will never die""."
466,Amitabh,"Although his surname was Shrivastava, Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan (""child-like"" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works."
467,Amitabh,"It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family."
468,Amitabh,"Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007."
469,Amitabh,"Bachchan is an alumnus of Sherwood College, Nainital."
470,Amitabh,"He later attended Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi."
471,Amitabh,"He has a younger brother, Ajitabh."
472,Amitabh,"His mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties."
473,Amitabh,"Teji had some influence in Amitabh Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should ""take the centre stage""."
474,Amitabh,He is married to actress Jaya Bhaduri.
475,Amitabh,"Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award-winning film Bhuvan Shome."
476,Amitabh,"His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani, directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha."
477,Amitabh,"Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna."
478,Amitabh,His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award.
479,Amitabh,He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971).
480,Amitabh,Following Parwana were several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971).
481,Amitabh,"During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri."
482,Amitabh,He narrated part of the film Bawarchi.
483,Amitabh,In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful.
484,Amitabh,"Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change."
485,Amitabh,"Bachchan was struggling, seen as a ""failed newcomer"" who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in Bombay to Goa and supporting role in Anand)."
486,Amitabh,"Bachchan was soon discovered by screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar."
487,Amitabh,"Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of Zanjeer (1973), and conceived the ""angry young man"" persona of the lead role."
488,Amitabh,"Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer, and Prakash Mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director."
489,Amitabh,"However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead ""angry young man"" role; it was turned down by a number of actors, owing to it going against the ""romantic hero"" image dominant in the industry at the time."
490,Amitabh,"Salim-Javed soon discovered Bachchan and ""saw his talent, which most makers didn't."
491,Amitabh,"He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren't good."""
492,Amitabh,"According to Salim Khan, they ""strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for Zanjeer""."
493,Amitabh,"Salim Khan introduced Bachchan to Prakash Mehra, and Salim-Javed insisted that Bachchan be cast for the role."
494,Amitabh,"Zanjeer was a crime film with violent action, in sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it, and it established Amitabh in a new persona—the ""angry young man"" of Bollywood cinema."
495,Amitabh,"He earned his first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor, with Filmfare later considering this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history."
496,Amitabh,"The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star."
497,Amitabh,"It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan; Salim-Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as Deewaar (1975) and Sholay (1975)."
498,Amitabh,"Salim Khan also introduced Bachchan to director Manmohan Desai with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside Prakash Mehra and Yash Chopra."
499,Amitabh,"Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry."
500,Amitabh,"Bachchan's portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like Zanjeer, Deeewar, Trishul, Kaala Patthar and Shakti resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harboured a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, corruption, social inequality and the brutal excesses of The Emergency."
501,Amitabh,"This led to Bachchan being dubbed as ""angry young man"", a journalistic catchphrase which became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s India."
502,Amitabh,"The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only Zanjeer but also subsequent films such as Abhimaan, which was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office."
503,Amitabh,"Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film Namak Haraam, a social drama directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship."
504,Amitabh,His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award.
505,Amitabh,"In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as Kunwara Baap and Dost, before playing a supporting role in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan."
506,Amitabh,"The film, directed and written by Manoj Kumar, addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top-earning film of 1974."
507,Amitabh,Bachchan then played the leading role in the film Majboor.
508,Amitabh,The film was a success at the box office.
509,Amitabh,"In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy Chupke Chupke and the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili."
510,Amitabh,"This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan."
511,Amitabh,"The first was Deewaar, directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu Singh, and earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor."
512,Amitabh,"The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number four."
513,Amitabh,Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.
514,Amitabh,"The other, released on 15 August 1975, was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev."
515,Amitabh,"Deewaar and Sholay are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer, and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s."
516,Amitabh,"In 1999, BBC India declared Sholay the ""Film of the Millennium"" and, like Deewar, it has been cited by Indiatimes Movies as amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films."
517,Amitabh,"In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years."
518,Amitabh,"In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama Kabhie Kabhie."
519,Amitabh,"Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi Kapoor)."
520,Amitabh,"The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his ""angry young man"" roles like Zanjeer and Deewar."
521,Amitabh,The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike.
522,Amitabh,Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film.
523,Amitabh,That same year he played a double role in the hit Adalat as father and son.
524,Amitabh,"In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony, in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves."
525,Amitabh,The film was the highest-grossing film of that year.
526,Amitabh,His other successes that year include Parvarish and Khoon Pasina.
527,Amitabh,"He once again resumed double roles in films such as Kasme Vaade (1978) as Amit and Shankar and Don (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay."
528,Amitabh,His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award.
529,Amitabh,He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's  Trishul and Prakash Mehra's Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations.
530,Amitabh,"1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul, Don, Kasme Vaade, Ganga Ki Saugandh and Besharam were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema."
531,Amitabh,"In 1979, Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest earning film of that year."
532,Amitabh,"In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like Mr. Natwarlal, Kaala Patthar, The Great Gambler and Manzil."
533,Amitabh,Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred with Rekha.
534,Amitabh,Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer.
535,Amitabh,"He also received Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman."
536,Amitabh,Dostana proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980.
537,Amitabh,"In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila, where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha."
538,Amitabh,"Other successful films of this period include Shaan (1980), Ram Balram (1980), Naseeb (1981), Lawaaris (1981), Kaalia (1981), Yaarana (1981), Barsaat Ki Ek Raat (1981) and Shakti (1982), also starring Dilip Kumar."
539,Amitabh,"In 1982, he played double roles in the musical Satte Pe Satta and action drama Desh Premee which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action comedy Namak Halaal, action drama Khud-Daar and the critically acclaimed drama Bemisal."
540,Amitabh,"In 1983, he played a triple role in Mahaan which was not as successful as his previous films."
541,Amitabh,"Other releases during that year included Nastik, Andha Kanoon (in which he had an extended guest appearance) which were hits and Pukar was an average grosser During a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, his completed films Mard (1985) and Aakhree Raasta (1986) were released and were major hits."
542,Amitabh,Coolie injury
543,Amitabh,"On 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie, in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near-fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar."
544,Amitabh,Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground.
545,Amitabh,"However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood."
546,Amitabh,"He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death."
547,Amitabh,"The overwhelming public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating."
548,Amitabh,"Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation."
549,Amitabh,"The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year."
550,Amitabh,"The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident."
551,Amitabh,"Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end."
552,Amitabh,"It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen."
553,Amitabh,"Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident."
554,Amitabh,"Later, he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis."
555,Amitabh,His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics.
556,Amitabh,"At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, ""Yeh film to flop hogi!"""
557,Amitabh,"(""This film will flop"")."
558,Amitabh,"After a three-year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in Shahenshah, which was a box office success."
559,Amitabh,"After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like Jaadugar, Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) failed at the box office."
560,Amitabh,"Successes during this period like the crime drama Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) and action crime drama Hum (1991), for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like they might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued."
561,Amitabh,"Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 cult film Agneepath."
562,Amitabh,These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time.
563,Amitabh,"After the release of the critically acclaimed epic Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years."
564,Amitabh,"With the exception of the delayed release of Insaniyat (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years."
565,Amitabh,"Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996."
566,Amitabh,ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry.
567,Amitabh,"ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management."
568,Amitabh,"Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was Tere Mere Sapne, which was a moderate success and launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and southern film star Simran."
569,Amitabh,"In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata, produced by ABCL."
570,Amitabh,"Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically."
571,Amitabh,"ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996 Miss World beauty pageant, Bangalore, but lost millions."
572,Amitabh,"The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997."
573,Amitabh,The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board.

592,Amitabh,"A remake of his biggest hit, Sholay (1975), entitled Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception."
593,Amitabh,"The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, co-starring Arjun Rampal and Preity Zinta."

601,Amitabh,"Paa, which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009."
602,Amitabh,It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award.
603,Amitabh,"In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through Kandahar, directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal."

609,Amitabh,"A review in Daily News and Analysis (DNA) summarised Bachchan's performance as ""The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements."
610,Amitabh,"His performance in Piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career."""
611,Amitabh,"Rachel Saltz wrote for The New York Times, ""Piku,"" an offbeat Hindi comedy, would have you contemplate the intestines and mortality of one Bhashkor Banerji and the actor who plays him, Amitabh Bachchan."
612,Amitabh,"Bhashkor's life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there's no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that Mr. Bachchan, India's erstwhile Angry Young Man, musters for his new role of Cranky Old Man."""
613,Amitabh,"Well known Indian critic Rajeev Masand wrote on his website, ""Bachchan is pretty terrific as Bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for."
614,Amitabh,"He bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects that Piku stay unmarried so she can attend to him."
615,Amitabh,"At one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn't a virgin; that she's financially independent and sexually independent too."
616,Amitabh,"Bachchan embraces the character's many idiosyncrasies, never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing."
617,Amitabh,"The Guardian summed up, ""Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up."""
618,Amitabh,The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.
619,Amitabh,"In 2016, he appeared in the women-centric courtroom drama film Pink which was highly praised by critics and with an increasingly good word of mouth, was a resounding success at the domestic and overseas box office."
620,Amitabh,Bachchan's performance in the film received acclaim.
621,Amitabh,"According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, ""Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer suffering from bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace."
622,Amitabh,"Like we know from Prakash Mehra movies, into each life some Bachchan must fall."
623,Amitabh,"The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has."
624,Amitabh,"At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary."
625,Amitabh,"Bachchan towers through Pink – the way he bellows ""et cetera"" is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play—but there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated."""
626,Amitabh,"Writing for Hindustan Times, noted film critic and author Anupama Chopra said of Bachchan's performance, ""A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty."

631,Amitabh,"Mike McCahill of The Guardian remarked, ""Among an electric ensemble, Tapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang give unwavering voice to the girls’ struggles; Amitabh Bachchan brings his moral authority to bear as their sole legal ally."

646,Amitabh,"Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi Party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha."
647,Amitabh,"Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi Party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns."

777,Modi,"Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures."
778,Modi,"In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh."
779,Modi,"Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency."
780,Modi,"He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985."
781,Modi,"In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers."
782,Modi,"After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987."
783,Modi,"Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–92 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity)."
784,Modi,"However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision."
785,Modi,"Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections."
786,Modi,"In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh."
787,Modi,"The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections."
788,Modi,"Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party."
789,Modi,"His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year."
790,Modi,"In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections."
791,Modi,"Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001."
792,Modi,"The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement."
793,Modi,"Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was ""going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all""."
794,Modi,"On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections."
795,Modi,"Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes."
796,Modi,"On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people."
797,Modi,The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.
798,Modi,"In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims."
799,Modi,"The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state."
800,Modi,"Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat."
801,Modi,The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.
802,Modi,The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.
803,Modi,Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.
804,Modi,"Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps."
805,Modi,Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.
806,Modi,"The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation."
807,Modi,"Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism."
808,Modi,"Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: ""There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law."""
809,Modi,"The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating."
810,Modi,"The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time."
811,Modi,"State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there."
812,Modi,"Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court."
813,Modi,"During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able."
814,Modi,"In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots."
815,Modi,"Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013."
816,Modi,"On 21 April 2018, the Gujarat High Court acquitted Kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation."
817,Modi,Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated.
818,Modi,"During the riots, Modi said that ""What is happening is a chain of action and reaction."""
819,Modi,"Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode."
820,Modi,"In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue."
821,Modi,"In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings."
822,Modi,"The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him."
823,Modi,"In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court."
824,Modi,"Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence."
825,Modi,The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court.
826,Modi,"The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed."
827,Modi,Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response.
828,Modi,"In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister."
829,Modi,"In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue."
830,Modi,"Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted."
831,Modi,"His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved."
832,Modi,"Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002."
833,Modi,"In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly."
834,Modi,"Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters."
835,Modi,"He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 113,589 of 154,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes."
836,Modi,"On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term."
837,Modi,"Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly."
838,Modi,During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.
839,Modi,"Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet."
840,Modi,"When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP."
841,Modi,Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions.
842,Modi,"Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists."
843,Modi,"Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies."
844,Modi,Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism.
845,Modi,"Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections."
846,Modi,After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.
847,Modi,Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister.
848,Modi,"Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law."
849,Modi,The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots.
850,Modi,"As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington."
851,Modi,"During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism."
852,Modi,"In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation"" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act."
853,Modi,He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.
854,Modi,"In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging."
855,Modi,"In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a ""spiritual experience"" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits."
856,Modi,"However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct."
857,Modi,"After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats."
858,Modi,"In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election."
859,Modi,"As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation."
860,Modi,His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state.
861,Modi,"He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion were signed."
862,Modi,The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects.
863,Modi,"By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them."
864,Modi,Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.
865,Modi,"As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India."
866,Modi,The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.
867,Modi,"Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful."
868,Modi,The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended.
869,Modi,"Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state."
870,Modi,"However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent."
871,Modi,In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal.
872,Modi,Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat.
873,Modi,The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.
874,Modi,"Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers."
875,Modi,"Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost."
876,Modi,"Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers."
877,Modi,A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.
878,Modi,"The state's GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole."
879,Modi,"Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure."
880,Modi,"Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's ""ease of doing business"" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years."
881,Modi,"In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for ""economic freedom"" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states."
882,Modi,"In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism."
883,Modi,"Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land."
884,Modi,"Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened."
885,Modi,"Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure."
886,Modi,"In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education."
887,Modi,"Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the ""alarming"" category on the India State Hunger Index."
888,Modi,A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.
889,Modi,"Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states."
890,Modi,"It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined."
891,Modi,"With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states."
892,Modi,"The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities."
893,Modi,"Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised."
894,Modi,In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.
895,Modi,"Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare."
896,Modi,"Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism."
897,Modi,"Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders."
898,Modi,During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.
899,Modi,"He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra."
900,Modi,"His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh."
901,Modi,The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.
902,Modi,"During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India."
903,Modi,"While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election."
904,Modi,"In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt."
905,Modi,"The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995)."
906,Modi,"In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates."
907,Modi,"In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans."
908,Modi,"After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014."
909,Modi,Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.
910,Modi,In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.
911,Modi,"Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were ""concerned with their personal agendas""."
912,Modi,Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign.
913,Modi,"Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party."
914,Modi,The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.
915,Modi,The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.
916,Modi,"During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat."
917,Modi,"Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about ""development,"" without focus on any specific policies."
918,Modi,His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens.
919,Modi,"The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism."
920,Modi,"Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development, although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign."
921,Modi,The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.
922,Modi,"Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately ₹50 billion (US$700 million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors."
923,Modi,"In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances."
924,Modi,"The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984."
925,Modi,"Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS."
926,Modi,"In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before."
927,Modi,It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.
928,Modi,The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing.
929,Modi,"Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism."
930,Modi,Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara.
931,Modi,"He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes."
932,Modi,"Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president."
933,Modi,"To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat."
934,Modi,Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014.
935,Modi,He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire.
936,Modi,His first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.
937,Modi,Modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.
938,Modi,"Initially lacking a majority in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power."
939,Modi,"The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary."
940,Modi,"In December 2014 Modi abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog."
941,Modi,The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.
942,Modi,"The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice."
943,Modi,The Modi government launched investigations by the Intelligence Bureau against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration.
944,Modi,"The investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a witchhunt."
945,Modi,International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure.
946,Modi,Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz.
947,Modi,Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government.
948,Modi,This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.
949,Modi,"Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years."
950,Modi,"He started a monthly radio programme titled ""Mann Ki Baat"" on 3 October 2014."
951,Modi,"Modi also launched the Digital India programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy."
952,Modi,Modi launched Ujjwala scheme to provide free LPG connection to rural households.
953,Modi,The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014.
954,Modi,"In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections."
955,Modi,He was again sworn in as Prime minister on 30 May 2019.
956,Modi,"On 30 July 2019, Parliament of India declared the practice of Triple Talaq as illegal, unconstitutional and made it punishable act from 1 August 2019 which is deemed to be in effect from 19 September 2018."
957,Modi,"On 5 August 2019, the government moved resolution to scrap Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha, and also reorganize the state with Jammu and Kashmir serving as one of the union territory and Ladakh region separated out as a separate union territory."
958,Modi,"In 2019, Ayodhya dispute was resolved."
959,Modi,The Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple.
960,Modi,It also ordered the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.
961,Modi,"The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework."
962,Modi,"Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways."
963,Modi,Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests.
964,Modi,"The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP."
965,Modi,"The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers."
966,Modi,The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.
967,Modi,The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi's first year in office.
968,Modi,"Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%."
969,Modi,"The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the ""education for all"" programme, declined by 22%."
970,Modi,"The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery."
971,Modi,"In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices."
972,Modi,"In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub."
973,Modi,"Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market."
974,Modi,"Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it."

988,Modi,"The policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations."

1019,Modi,"Between 2015 and 2018, Human Rights Watch estimated that 44 people, most of them Muslim, were killed by vigilantes; the killings were described by commentators as related to attempts by BJP state governments to ban the slaughter of cows."

1042,Modi,The military budget declined over Modi's tenure both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.

1065,Modi,"Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity."
1066,Modi,"A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating."
1067,Modi,"Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas."

1073,Modi,"In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child."
1074,Modi,"He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18."
1075,Modi,"They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams."

1173,Beatles,"After the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement."
1174,Beatles,"However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night."
1175,Beatles,"In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist."
1176,Beatles,"He later recalled: ""I immediately liked what I heard."
1177,Beatles,"They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ...  star quality."""
1178,Beatles,"Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962."
1179,Beatles,"Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions."
1180,Beatles,He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.
1181,Beatles,"Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what was later determined as a brain haemorrhage."
1182,Beatles,Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract.
1183,Beatles,"To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan."
1184,Beatles,"After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment ""Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr."
1185,Beatles,"However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label."
1186,Beatles,Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962.
1187,Beatles,Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place.
1188,Beatles,"Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them."
1189,Beatles,"A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of ""Love Me Do"" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of ""Love Me Do"", ""Please Please Me"" and ""P.S."
1190,Beatles,"I Love You""."
1191,Beatles,"Martin initially selected the Starr version of ""Love Me Do"" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine."
1192,Beatles,"Released in early October, ""Love Me Do"" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart."
1193,Beatles,Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.
1194,Beatles,"After Martin suggested rerecording ""Please Please Me"" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, ""You've just made your first No."
1195,Beatles,"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency."
1196,Beatles,"By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group."
1197,Beatles,"Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist."
1198,Beatles,"Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing."
1199,Beatles,"Lennon recalled him saying, ""Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...."" Lennon said: ""We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage."
1200,Beatles,"He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square."
1201,Beatles,"He'd let us have our own sense of individuality."""
1202,Beatles,"On 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, Please Please Me."
1203,Beatles,The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles.
1204,Beatles,"Martin originally considered recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a ""live"" album with minimal production in ""a single marathon session at Abbey Road""."
1205,Beatles,"After the moderate success of ""Love Me Do"", the single ""Please Please Me"" met with a more emphatic reception."
1206,Beatles,"Released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album of the same name, the song reached number one on every UK chart except Record Retailer, where it peaked at number two."
1207,Beatles,"Recalling how the Beatles ""rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out Please Please Me in a day"", AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments, ""Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins."""
1208,Beatles,"Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were ""just writing songs à la Everly Brothers, à la Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound."
1209,Beatles,"And the words were almost irrelevant."""
1210,Beatles,"Released in March 1963, the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through to 1970 reached number one."
1211,Beatles,"The band's third single, ""From Me to You"", came out in April and was also a chart-topping hit, starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles for the Beatles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years."
1212,Beatles,"Issued in August, the band's fourth single, ""She Loves You"", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks."
1213,Beatles,"It became their first single to sell a million copies, and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978."
1214,Beatles,"Their commercial success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest."
1215,Beatles,"The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May–June."
1216,Beatles,"As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold."
1217,Beatles,"Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans, the press dubbed the phenomenon ""Beatlemania""."
1218,Beatles,"Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing ""by audience demand"", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US."
1219,Beatles,A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.
1220,Beatles,"In late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962."
1221,Beatles,"On their return to the UK on 31 October, several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport."
1222,Beatles,"Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers, as well as representatives from the BBC, also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events."
1223,Beatles,"The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks."
1224,Beatles,"In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth."
1225,Beatles,"Please Please Me maintained the top position on the Record Retailer chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, With the Beatles, which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies."
1226,Beatles,The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week.
1227,Beatles,"Recorded between July and October, With the Beatles made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor."
1228,Beatles,It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks.
1229,Beatles,"Erlewine described the LP as ""a sequel of the highest order – one that betters the original""."
1230,Beatles,"In a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales."
1231,Beatles,"The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of The Times, who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were ""the outstanding English composers of 1963""."
1232,Beatles,"The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability."
1233,Beatles,"With the Beatles became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 South Pacific soundtrack."
1234,Beatles,"When writing the sleeve notes for the album, the band's press officer, Tony Barrow, used the superlative the ""fabulous foursome"", which the media widely adopted as ""the Fab Four""."
1235,Beatles,"EMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles."
1236,Beatles,"Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963, but not all."
1237,Beatles,Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album Introducing...
1238,Beatles,"The Beatles, culled from most of the songs of Parlophone's Please Please Me, but a management shake-up led to the album not being released."
1239,Beatles,"Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence Vee-Jay signed with EMI was voided."
1240,Beatles,"A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single ""She Loves You""."
1241,Beatles,"The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the ""Rate-a-Record"" segment of American Bandstand, but it failed to catch on nationally."
1242,Beatles,"Epstein arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign."
1243,Beatles,"American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air."
1244,Beatles,Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US.
1245,Beatles,"This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward the release of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" by three weeks."
1246,Beatles,"Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January."
1247,Beatles,"In its wake, Vee-Jay released Introducing..."
1248,Beatles,"The Beatles to go along with Capitol's debut album, Meet the Beatles!, while Swan reactivated production of ""She Loves You""."
1249,Beatles,"On 7 February 1964, the Beatles left the United Kingdom with an estimated 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow, waving and screaming as the aircraft took off."
1250,Beatles,"Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them."
1251,Beatles,"They gave their first live US television performance two days later on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 percent of the American population."
1252,Beatles,"Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was ""the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television program""."
1253,Beatles,"The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a largely negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later at their first US concert, Beatlemania erupted at the Washington Coliseum."
1254,Beatles,"Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall."
1255,Beatles,"The band flew to Florida, where they appeared on the weekly Ed Sullivan Show a second time, before another 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February."
1256,Beatles,The Beatles' first visit to the United States took place when the nation was still mourning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous November.
1257,Beatles,"Commentators often suggest that for many, particularly the young, the Beatles' performances reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination, and helped make way for the revolutionary social changes to come in the decade."
1258,Beatles,"Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture."
1259,Beatles,"The group's popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and many other UK acts subsequently made their American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion."
1260,Beatles,"The Beatles' success in the US opened the door for a successive string of British beat groups and pop acts such as the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones to achieve success in America."
1261,Beatles,"During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five."
1262,Beatles,"Capitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 did not go unnoticed, and a competitor, United Artists Records, encouraged their film division to offer the Beatles a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks in the US."
1263,Beatles,"Directed by Richard Lester, A Hard Day's Night involved the band for six weeks in March–April 1964 as they played themselves in a musical comedy."
1264,Beatles,"The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing a comparison with the Marx Brothers."
1265,Beatles,"United Artists released a full soundtrack album for the North American market, combining Beatles songs and Martin's orchestral score; elsewhere, the group's third studio LP, A Hard Day's Night, contained songs from the film on side one and other new recordings on side two."
1266,Beatles,"According to Erlewine, the album saw them ""truly coming into their own as a band."
1267,Beatles,"All of the disparate influences on their first two albums coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies."""
1268,Beatles,"That ""ringing guitar"" sound was primarily the product of Harrison's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, a prototype given to him by the manufacturer, which made its debut on the record."
1269,Beatles,"Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand."
1270,Beatles,"In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities."
1271,Beatles,"Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York."
1272,Beatles,"In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan."
1273,Beatles,"Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis."
1274,Beatles,"Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were ""perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds"": Dylan's audience of ""college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style"" contrasted with their fans, ""veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion."
1275,Beatles,"To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists."""
1276,Beatles,"Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, ""Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona""; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and ""dressed in the height of Mod fashion""."
1277,Beatles,"As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts ""nearly evaporated"", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture."
1278,Beatles,"During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South."
1279,Beatles,"When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, was segregated, the Beatles said they would refuse to perform unless the audience was integrated."
1280,Beatles,"Lennon stated: ""We never play to segregated audiences and we aren't going to start now ..."
1281,Beatles,"I'd sooner lose our appearance money."""
1282,Beatles,City officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show.
1283,Beatles,The group also cancelled their reservations at the whites-only Hotel George Washington in Jacksonville.
1284,Beatles,"For their subsequent US tours in 1965 and 1966, the Beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated."
1285,Beatles,"According to Gould, Beatles for Sale, the Beatles' fourth studio LP, evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions."
1286,Beatles,"They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by A Hard Day's Night which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs."
1287,Beatles,"They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, ""Material's becoming a hell of a problem""."
1288,Beatles,"As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album."
1289,Beatles,"Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership."
1290,Beatles,"In early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and their wives, Harrison's dentist, John Riley, secretly added LSD to their coffee."
1291,Beatles,"Lennon described the experience: ""It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic."
1292,Beatles,"I was pretty stunned for a month or two."""
1293,Beatles,"He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion."
1294,Beatles,Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism.
1295,Beatles,"He commented: ""For me, it was like a flash."
1296,Beatles,"The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things."
1297,Beatles,"I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them."
1298,Beatles,"From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."""
1299,Beatles,"McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966."
1300,Beatles,"He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that ""it opened my eyes"" and ""made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society""."
1301,Beatles,Controversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award.
1302,Beatles,In protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their insignia.
1303,Beatles,"In July, the Beatles' second film, Help!, was released, again directed by Lester."
1304,Beatles,"Described as ""mainly a relentless spoof of Bond"", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band."
1305,Beatles,"McCartney said: ""Help!"
1306,Beatles,was great but it wasn't our film – we were sort of guest stars.
1307,Beatles,"It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong."""
1308,Beatles,"The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: ""Help!"""
1309,Beatles,"and ""Ticket to Ride""."
1310,Beatles,The accompanying Help!
1311,Beatles,"album, the group's fifth studio LP, mirrored A Hard Day's Night by featuring soundtrack songs on side one and additional songs from the same sessions on side two."
1312,Beatles,"The LP contained all original material save for two covers, ""Act Naturally"" and ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy""; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, except for Let It Be's brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song ""Maggie Mae""."
1313,Beatles,The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on Help!
1314,Beatles,"and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad ""Yesterday""."
1315,Beatles,"Composed by and sung by McCartney – none of the other Beatles perform on the recording – ""Yesterday"" inspired the most cover versions of any song ever written."
1316,Beatles,"With Help!, the Beatles became the first rock group to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year."
1317,Beatles,"The group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 – ""perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts"", in Lewisohn's description."
1318,Beatles,A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities.
1319,Beatles,"At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers."
1320,Beatles,"Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills."
1321,Beatles,"September saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series, The Beatles, that echoed A Hard Day's Night's slapstick antics over its two-year original run."
1322,Beatles,"The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people."
1323,Beatles,"In mid-October 1965, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments."
1324,Beatles,"Until this time, according to George Martin, ""we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles."
1325,Beatles,"Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own."""
1326,Beatles,"Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music."
1327,Beatles,Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy.
1328,Beatles,"Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to ""the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana"", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as ""the pot album"", and Starr said: ""Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers."
1329,Beatles,"And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently."""
1330,Beatles,After Help!
1331,Beatles,"'s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music."
1332,Beatles,"As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning."
1333,Beatles,"Of ""Norwegian Wood"" Lennon commented: ""I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair ... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell."""
1334,Beatles,"While many of Rubber Soul's prominent songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit."
1335,Beatles,"The song ""In My Life"", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue."
1336,Beatles,"Harrison called Rubber Soul his ""favourite album"" and Starr referred to it as ""the departure record""."
1337,Beatles,"McCartney has said, ""We'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."""
1338,Beatles,"However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – ""the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious"", he wrote, and ""as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right""."
1339,Beatles,"In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as ""one of the classic folk-rock records""."
1340,Beatles,"Capitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format, compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles."
1341,Beatles,"In June 1966, Yesterday and Today, one of Capitol's compilation albums, caused an uproar with its cover, which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher's overalls, accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls."
1342,Beatles,"According to Beatles biographer Bill Harry, it has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" the US versions of the band's albums."
1343,Beatles,"Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original; an unpeeled ""first-state"" copy fetched $10,500 at a December 2005 auction."
1344,Beatles,"In England, meanwhile, Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who agreed to train him on the instrument."
1345,Beatles,"During a tour of the Philippines the month after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace."
1346,Beatles,"When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations."
1347,Beatles,They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer.
1348,Beatles,The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty.
1349,Beatles,"Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time."
1350,Beatles,"– John Lennon, 1966"
1351,Beatles,"Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave."
1352,Beatles,"""Christianity will go,"" Lennon had said."
1353,Beatles,"""It will vanish and shrink."
1354,Beatles,I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right.
1355,Beatles,... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary.
1356,Beatles,"It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."""
1357,Beatles,"The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in America's conservative Bible Belt region."
1358,Beatles,"The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service."
1359,Beatles,"Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, ""If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it."""
1360,Beatles,"Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: ""If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry."""
1361,Beatles,"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard."
1362,Beatles,"Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate."
1363,Beatles,"Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live."
1364,Beatles,"Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last."
1365,Beatles,"Rubber Soul had marked a major step forward; Revolver, released in August 1966 a week before the Beatles' final tour, marked another."
1366,Beatles,"Pitchfork's Scott Plagenhoef identifies it as ""the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence"" and ""redefining what was expected from popular music""."
1367,Beatles,"Revolver featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation, and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock."
1368,Beatles,"Abandoning the customary group photograph, its cover – designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg days – ""was a stark, arty, black-and-white collage that caricatured the Beatles in a pen-and-ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley"", in Gould's description."
1369,Beatles,"The album was preceded by the single ""Paperback Writer"", backed by ""Rain""."
1370,Beatles,"Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as ""among the first true music videos"", they aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966."
1371,Beatles,"Among the experimental songs that Revolver featured was ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead."
1372,Beatles,"Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data."
1373,Beatles,"McCartney's ""Eleanor Rigby"" made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as ""a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song""."
1374,Beatles,"Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned a place on the record."
1375,Beatles,"In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time."
1376,Beatles,"During the US tour that followed Revolver's release, the band performed none of its songs."
1377,Beatles,"As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much ""studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams."
1378,Beatles,"'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts."""
1379,Beatles,The band's concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert.
1380,Beatles,"It marked the end of four years dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally."
1381,Beatles,"Freed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded Sgt."
1382,Beatles,"Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, beginning in late November 1966."
1383,Beatles,"According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours."
1384,Beatles,"He recalled the band's insistence ""that everything on Sgt."
1385,Beatles,Pepper had to be different.
1386,Beatles,We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins.
1387,Beatles,"We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around."""
1388,Beatles,"Parts of ""A Day in the Life"" featured a 40-piece orchestra."
1389,Beatles,"The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/""Penny Lane"" in February 1967; the Sgt."
1390,Beatles,Pepper LP followed with a rush-release in May.
1391,Beatles,"The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists."
1392,Beatles,"Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal."
1393,Beatles,Gould writes:
1394,Beatles,"The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a popular masterpiece: a rich, sustained, and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be."
1395,Beatles,"On the basis of this perception, Sgt."
1396,Beatles,Pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963.
1397,Beatles,In the wake of Sgt.
1398,Beatles,"Pepper, the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as ""lifestyle revolutionaries""."
1399,Beatles,"The album was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover."
1400,Beatles,"Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were ""listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy""."
1401,Beatles,The elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study.
1402,Beatles,"A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people."
1403,Beatles,"The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their ""brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms"" as a knowingly ""anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment"" display."
1404,Beatles,"Pepper topped the UK charts for 23 consecutive weeks, with a further four weeks at number one in the period through to February 1968."
1405,Beatles,"With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt."
1406,Beatles,Pepper's initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums.
1407,Beatles,It sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records.
1408,Beatles,"In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Sgt."
1409,Beatles,Pepper foremost on its list of the greatest albums of all time.
1410,Beatles,Two Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of completing Sgt.
1411,Beatles,"Pepper: Magical Mystery Tour, a one-hour television film, and Yellow Submarine, an animated feature-length film produced by United Artists."
1412,Beatles,"The group began recording music for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter."
1413,Beatles,"On 25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single ""All You Need Is Love"" to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link."
1414,Beatles,"Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem."
1415,Beatles,The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs was at its height during that summer.
1416,Beatles,"In July and August, the group pursued interests related to similar utopian-based ideology, including a week-long investigation into the possibility of starting an island-based commune off the coast of Greece."
1417,Beatles,"On 24 August, the group were introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London."
1418,Beatles,"The next day, they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat."
1419,Beatles,"On 27 August, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein had died."
1420,Beatles,"The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide."
1421,Beatles,His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future.
1422,Beatles,"Lennon recalled: ""We collapsed."
1423,Beatles,I knew that we were in trouble then.
1424,Beatles,"I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared."
1425,Beatles,"I thought, 'We've fuckin' had it now.'"""
1426,Beatles,"Harrison's then-wife Pattie Boyd remembered that ""Paul and George were in complete shock."
1427,Beatles,"I don't think it could have been worse if they had heard that their own fathers had dropped dead."""
1428,Beatles,"During a band meeting in September, McCartney recommended that the band proceed with Magical Mystery Tour."
1429,Beatles,The Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play (EP) in early December 1967.
1430,Beatles,It was the first example of a double EP in the UK.
1431,Beatles,The record carried on the psychedelic vein of Sgt.
1432,Beatles,"Pepper, however, in line with the band's wishes, the packaging reinforced the idea that the release was a film soundtrack rather than a follow-up to Sgt."
1433,Beatles,"In the US, the soundtrack appeared as an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles."
1434,Beatles,"In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums."
1435,Beatles,"First aired on Boxing Day to an audience of approximately 15 million, the Magical Mystery Tour film brought the group their first critical failure in the UK, largely directed by McCartney."
1436,Beatles,"It was dismissed as ""blatant rubbish"" by the Daily Express; the Daily Mail called it ""a colossal conceit""; and The Guardian labelled the film ""a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience""."
1437,Beatles,"Gould describes it as ""a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus""."
1438,Beatles,"Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film."
1439,Beatles,"The group were less involved with Yellow Submarine, which only featured the band appearing as themselves for a short live-action segment."
1440,Beatles,"Premiering in July 1968, the film featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film."
1441,Beatles,"Critics praised the film for its music, humour and innovative visual style."
1442,Beatles,"A soundtrack LP was issued seven months later; it contained those four new songs, the title track (already issued on Revolver), ""All You Need Is Love"" (already issued as a single and on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin."
1443,Beatles,"In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, to take part in a three-month meditation ""Guide Course""."
1444,Beatles,"Their time in India marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album."
1445,Beatles,"However, Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later."
1446,Beatles,"For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them."
1447,Beatles,"When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him."
1448,Beatles,"In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled ""Maharishi"", renamed ""Sexy Sadie"" to avoid potential legal issues."
1449,Beatles,"McCartney said, ""We made a mistake."
1450,Beatles,"We thought there was more to him than there was."""
1451,Beatles,"In May, Lennon and McCartney traveled to New York for the public unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, Apple Corps."
1452,Beatles,"It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record distribution, peace activism, and education."
1453,Beatles,"McCartney described Apple as ""rather like a Western communism""."
1454,Beatles,"The enterprise drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects handled largely by members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless of talent and experience."
1455,Beatles,"Among its numerous subsidiaries were Apple Electronics, established to foster technological innovations with Magic Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived Apple Boutique in London."
1456,Beatles,"Harrison later said, ""Basically, it was chaos ... John and Paul got carried away with the idea and blew millions, and Ringo and I just had to go along with it."""
1457,Beatles,"From late May to mid-October 1968, the group recorded what became The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as ""the White Album"" for its virtually featureless cover."
1458,Beatles,"During this time, relations between the members grew openly divisive."
1459,Beatles,"Starr quit for two weeks, leaving his bandmates to record ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" and ""Dear Prudence"" as a trio."
1460,Beatles,"Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" he scorned as ""granny music shit""."
1461,Beatles,"Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio."
1462,Beatles,"McCartney has recalled that the album ""wasn't a pleasant one to make""."
1463,Beatles,He and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break-up.
1464,Beatles,"With the record, the band executed a wider range of musical styles and broke with their recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre."
1465,Beatles,"During the sessions, the group upgraded to an eight-track tape console, which made it easier for them to layer tracks piecemeal, while the members often recorded independently of each other, affording the album a reputation as a collection of solo recordings rather than a unified group effort."
1466,Beatles,"Describing the double album, Lennon later said: ""Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it."
1467,Beatles,"John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band."""
1468,Beatles,"The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, ""Hey Jude"", released in August as a non-album single with ""Revolution""."
1469,Beatles,"Issued in November, the White Album was the band's first Apple Records album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings."
1470,Beatles,"The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders, selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations."
1471,Beatles,Its lyric content was the focus of much analysis by the counterculture.
1472,Beatles,"Despite its popularity, reviewers were largely confused by the album's content, and it failed to inspire the level of critical writing that Sgt."
1473,Beatles,Pepper had.
1474,Beatles,"General critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album, and in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time."
1475,Beatles,"Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road."
1476,Beatles,"The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they ""record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film""."
1477,Beatles,"Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg."
1478,Beatles,"Martin said that the project was ""not at all a happy recording experience."
1479,Beatles,"It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb."""
1480,Beatles,"Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as ""hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth"", and Harrison, ""the low of all-time""."
1481,Beatles,"Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days."
1482,Beatles,"Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they ""abandon all talk of live performance"" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special."
1483,Beatles,"He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio."
1484,Beatles,"His bandmates agreed, and it was decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film."
1485,Beatles,"To alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions."
1486,Beatles,"Preston received label billing on the ""Get Back"" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release."
1487,Beatles,"After the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum."
1488,Beatles,"Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 1969."
1489,Beatles,"Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as Get Back's ""uncredited producer"", began work assembling an album, given ""free rein"" as the band ""all but washed their hands of the entire project""."
1490,Beatles,"New strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs."
1491,Beatles,"Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March."
1492,Beatles,"Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers."
1493,Beatles,"Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost."
1494,Beatles,"On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' lawyers."
1495,Beatles,"McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles."
1496,Beatles,"Martin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the Get Back sessions had been ""a miserable experience"" and he had ""thought it was the end of the road for all of us""."
1497,Beatles,The primary recording sessions for Abbey Road began on 2 July.
1498,Beatles,"Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a ""continuously moving piece of music"", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album."
1499,Beatles,"The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley, was McCartney's suggested compromise."
1500,Beatles,"Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio's valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its ""kinder, gentler"" feel relative to their previous albums."
1501,Beatles,"On 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"", credited to the Plastic Ono Band."
1502,Beatles,"The completion and mixing of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio."
1503,Beatles,"On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album."
1504,Beatles,"They considered a different approach to songwriting by ending the Lennon–McCartney pretense and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas."
1505,Beatles,"On 20 September, Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album."
1506,Beatles,"Released on 26 September, Abbey Road sold four million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks."
1507,Beatles,"Its second track, the ballad ""Something"", was issued as a single – the only Harrison composition that appeared as a Beatles A-side."
1508,Beatles,"Abbey Road received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim."
1509,Beatles,"Unterberger considers it ""a fitting swan song for the group"", containing ""some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record""."
1510,Beatles,"Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album ""erratic and often hollow"", despite the ""semblance of unity and coherence"" offered by the medley."
1511,Beatles,"Martin singled it out as his favourite Beatles album; Lennon said it was ""competent"" but had ""no life in it""."
1512,Beatles,"For the still unfinished Get Back album, one last song, Harrison's ""I Me Mine"", was recorded on 3 January 1970."
1513,Beatles,"Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate."
1514,Beatles,"In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled Let It Be, Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector, who had recently produced Lennon's solo single ""Instant Karma!"""
1515,Beatles,"In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as ""live""."
1516,Beatles,"McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on ""The Long and Winding Road"", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble."
1517,Beatles,"McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored, and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April, a week before the release of his first, self-titled solo album."
1518,Beatles,"On 8 May 1970, Let It Be was released."
1519,Beatles,"Its accompanying single, ""The Long and Winding Road"", was the Beatles' last; it was released in the US, but not in the UK."
1520,Beatles,"The Let It Be documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score."
1521,Beatles,"Sunday Telegraph critic Penelope Gilliatt called it ""a very bad film and a touching one ... about the breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings""."
1522,Beatles,Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks.
1523,Beatles,"Describing Let It Be as the ""only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews"", Unterberger calls it ""on the whole underrated""; he singles out ""some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'"", and praises ""Let It Be"", ""Get Back"", and ""the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together""."
1524,Beatles,McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970.
1525,Beatles,"Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida."
1526,Beatles,"Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970."
1527,Beatles,"Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others; Starr's Ringo (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs."
1528,Beatles,"With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971."
1529,Beatles,"Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as A Toot and a Snore in '74, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again."
1530,Beatles,"Two double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, 1962–1966 and 1967–1970, were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint."
1531,Beatles,"Commonly known as the ""Red Album"" and ""Blue Album"", respectively, each has earned a Multi-Platinum certification in the United States and a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom."
1532,Beatles,"Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music."
1533,Beatles,"The only one to feature previously unreleased material was The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours."
1534,Beatles,"The music and enduring fame of the Beatles were commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control."
1535,Beatles,"In April 1974, the musical John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert, written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson, opened in London."
1536,Beatles,"It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon-McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, ""Here Comes the Sun""."
1537,Beatles,"Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it."
1538,Beatles,"Later that year, the off-Broadway musical Sgt."
1539,Beatles,Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road opened.
1540,Beatles,All This and World War II (1976) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra.
1541,Beatles,"The Broadway musical Beatlemania, an unauthorised nostalgia revue, opened in early 1977 and proved popular, spinning off five separate touring productions."
1542,Beatles,"In 1979, the band sued the producers, settling for several million dollars in damages."
1543,Beatles,"Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978), a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was a commercial failure and an ""artistic fiasco"", according to Ingham."
1544,Beatles,"Accompanying the wave of Beatles nostalgia and persistent reunion rumours in the US during the 1970s, several entrepreneurs made public offers to the Beatles for a reunion concert."
1545,Beatles,Promoter Bill Sargent first offered the Beatles $10 million for a reunion concert in 1974.
1546,Beatles,He raised his offer to $30 million in January 1976 and then to $50 million the following month.
1547,Beatles,"On 24 April 1976, during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live, producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on the show."
1548,Beatles,"Lennon and McCartney were watching the live broadcast at Lennon's apartment at the Dakota in New York, which was within driving distance of the NBC studio where the show was being broadcast."
1549,Beatles,"The former bandmates briefly entertained the idea of going to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but decided not to."
1550,Beatles,"In December 1980, Lennon was shot and killed outside his New York City apartment."
1551,Beatles,"Harrison rewrote the lyrics of his song ""All Those Years Ago"" in Lennon's honour."
1552,Beatles,"With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981."
1553,Beatles,"McCartney's own tribute, ""Here Today"", appeared on his Tug of War album in April 1982."
1554,Beatles,"In 1987, Harrison's Cloud Nine album included ""When We Was Fab"", a song about the Beatlemania era."
1555,Beatles,"When the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of Magical Mystery Tour."
1556,Beatles,All the remaining material from the singles and EPs that had not appeared on these thirteen studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation Past Masters (1988).
1557,Beatles,"Except for the Red and Blue albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations – including the Hollywood Bowl record – from its catalogue."
1558,Beatles,"In 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility."
1559,Beatles,"Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean."
1560,Beatles,"McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved ""business differences"" that would make him ""feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion""."
1561,Beatles,"The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material."
1562,Beatles,"Live at the BBC, the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994."
1563,Beatles,"That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project."
1564,Beatles,"Anthology was the culmination of work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road."
1565,Beatles,"Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings."
1566,Beatles,"McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s."
1567,Beatles,"During 1995–96, the project yielded a television miniseries, an eight-volume video set, and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann."
1568,Beatles,"Two songs based on Lennon demos, ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"", were issued as new Beatles singles."

1571,Beatles,"The Beatles' 1, a compilation album of the band's British and American number-one hits, was released on 13 November 2000."
1572,Beatles,"It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month."
1573,Beatles,It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries.
1574,Beatles,"As of April 2009, the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally, and is the best-selling album of that decade in the United States."

1576,Beatles,"McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia."

1578,Beatles,"In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived version of the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released."
1579,Beatles,One of the main differences from the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements.
1580,Beatles,It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America.
1581,Beatles,"The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006; The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release."
1582,Beatles,"As a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, Love, George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called ""a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period""."

1591,Beatles,"Owing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services."
1592,Beatles,"Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name ""Apple"" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI ""want something we're not prepared to give them""."
1593,Beatles,"In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, Past Masters, and the ""Red"" and ""Blue"" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes."
1594,Beatles,"In 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group."

1599,Beatles,That December saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes.
1600,Beatles,"The set, titled The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963, had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013."
1601,Beatles,Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day.
1602,Beatles,"Fan reactions to the release were mixed, with one blogger saying ""the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these."""
1603,Beatles,"On 26 January 2014, McCartney and Starr performed together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles."
1604,Beatles,"The following day, The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center's West Hall."
1605,Beatles,"It aired on 9 February, the exact date of – and at the same time, and on the same network as – the original broadcast of the Beatles' first US television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, 50 years earlier."

1612,Beatles,"An expanded, remixed and remastered version of the 1977 live album The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl was released on 9 September 2016, to coincide with the release of the film."

1616,Beatles,"Similar box sets were released for The Beatles in November 2018, and Abbey Road in September 2019."
1617,Beatles,"On the first week of October 2019, Abbey Road returned to number one on the UK Albums Chart."
1618,Beatles,The Beatles broke their own record for the album with the longest gap between topping the charts as Abbey Road hit the top spot 50 years after its original release.
1619,Beatles,"In Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever, Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:"
1620,Beatles,"In their initial incarnation as cheerful, wisecracking moptops, the Fab Four revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts."
1621,Beatles,"Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there."
1622,Beatles,"Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release."
1623,Beatles,"The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work."
1624,Beatles,"In The Beatles as Musicians, Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: ""McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich."
1625,Beatles,"Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility."""
1626,Beatles,"Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as ""a natural melodist – a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony""."
1627,Beatles,"His melody lines are characterised as primarily ""vertical"", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his ""extrovert energy and optimism""."
1628,Beatles,"Conversely, Lennon's ""sedentary, ironic personality"" is reflected in a ""horizontal"" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: ""Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own."""
1629,Beatles,"MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his ""characterful lines and textural colourings"" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as ""the father of modern pop/rock drumming""."
1630,Beatles,"The band's earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Chuck Berry."
1631,Beatles,"During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs."
1632,Beatles,"Of Presley, Lennon said, ""Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis."
1633,Beatles,"If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles."""
1634,Beatles,"Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers."
1635,Beatles,"The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album Pet Sounds amazed and inspired McCartney."
1636,Beatles,"Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: ""No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian ."""
1637,Beatles,"Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years."
1638,Beatles,"Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music."
1639,Beatles,"Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of Beatles for Sale, ""You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP"", while Gould credits Rubber Soul as ""the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop""."
1640,Beatles,"Although the 1965 song ""Yesterday"" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements."
1641,Beatles,"Gould observes: ""The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars."""
1642,Beatles,They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; Sgt.
1643,Beatles,"Pepper's ""She's Leaving Home"", for instance, is ""cast in the mold of a sentimental Victorian ballad"", Gould writes, ""its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama""."
1644,Beatles,"The band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side ""Rain"", described by Martin Strong as ""the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record""."
1645,Beatles,"Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (recorded before ""Rain""), ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and ""I Am the Walrus""."
1646,Beatles,"The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison's ""The Inner Light"", ""Love You To"" and ""Within You Without You"" – Gould describes the latter two as attempts ""to replicate the raga form in miniature""."
1647,Beatles,"Innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: ""'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can."
1648,Beatles,"It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music."
1649,Beatles,It represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative.
1650,Beatles,"There literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively."""
1651,Beatles,"Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: ""the Beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way."""
1652,Beatles,"Author Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: ""Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville."
1653,Beatles,"One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy."""
1654,Beatles,"As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent."
1655,Beatles,"The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's ""Revolution 9"" (whose musique concrète approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song ""Don't Pass Me By"", Harrison's rock ballad ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", and the ""proto-metal roar"" of McCartney's ""Helter Skelter""."
1656,Beatles,"George Martin's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the ""fifth Beatle""."
1657,Beatles,"He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as ""an informal music teacher"" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould."
1658,Beatles,"Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of ""Yesterday"" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a ""hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour"", in MacDonald's description."
1659,Beatles,"Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding ""something baroque"" to a particular recording."
1660,Beatles,"In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and brass."
1661,Beatles,Collaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording.
1662,Beatles,"MacDonald comments, ""while  worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which 'Being for the Benefit of Mr."
1663,Beatles,"is an outstanding example."""
1664,Beatles,Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:
1665,Beatles,"Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality ... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work – 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ..."
1666,Beatles,"I always saw him as an aural Salvador Dalí, rather than some drug-ridden record artist."
1667,Beatles,"On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time ... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve ... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, Pepper would never have been the album it was."
1668,Beatles,"Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?"
1669,Beatles,"Harrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: ""I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape."""
1670,Beatles,"Making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers."
1671,Beatles,"Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music."
1672,Beatles,"Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and, especially, Revolver onwards."
1673,Beatles,"Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time."
1674,Beatles,"These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in ""Norwegian Wood"" and the swarmandal in ""Strawberry Fields Forever""."
1675,Beatles,"They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on ""Baby, You're a Rich Man""."
1676,Beatles,"Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as ""artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ..."" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as ""an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism"", and ""the first advance in popular music since the War""."
1677,Beatles,"They not only sparked the British Invasion of the United States, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well."
1678,Beatles,"From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee."
1679,Beatles,"The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture."
1680,Beatles,Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide.
1681,Beatles,Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs.
1682,Beatles,"On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio."
1683,Beatles,"They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with ""filler"", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video."
1684,Beatles,"The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a ""major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business""."
1685,Beatles,"Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion."
1686,Beatles,"According to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives."
1687,Beatles,"From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade."
1688,Beatles,"As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism."
1689,Beatles,"According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the ""more popular than Jesus"" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and ""began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness""."
1690,Beatles,"Other commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the United States, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness."
1691,Beatles,"Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: ""In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ..."
1692,Beatles,"The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964."""
1693,Beatles,According to Gilmore:
1694,Beatles,Elvis Presley had shown us how rebellion could be fashioned into eye-opening style; the Beatles were showing us how style could have the impact of cultural revelation – or at least how a pop vision might be forged into an unimpeachable consensus.
1695,Beatles,"In 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)."
1696,Beatles,The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970).
1697,Beatles,"The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the United States."
1698,Beatles,"In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album."
1699,Beatles,They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.
1700,Beatles,"The best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013."
1701,Beatles,"They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act."
1702,Beatles,"In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years."
1703,Beatles,"They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary."
1704,Beatles,"As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty."
1705,Beatles,"The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist."
1706,Beatles,They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.
1707,Beatles,"In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award."
1708,Beatles,"On 16 January each year, beginning in 2001, people celebrate World Beatles Day under UNESCO."
1709,Beatles,This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.
1710,Beatles,"Five asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles."
1711,Beatles,Principal members
1712,Beatles,Early members
1713,Beatles,Touring musician
1714,Beatles,"The above albums were reissued on CD in 1987, followed by the 1988 compilations Past Masters – Volume One and Past Masters – Volume Two, which collected all of the Beatles' non-album singles plus the 1964 EP Long Tall Sally and a few other rarities that were commercially available in the 1960s."
1715,Beatles,"Through 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by Northern Songs Ltd, a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists."
1716,Beatles,"The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share."
1717,Beatles,McCartney had 20%.
1718,Beatles,Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion – 19 or 20% – and Brian Epstein's – 9 or 10% – which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.
1719,Beatles,"In 1965, the company went public."
1720,Beatles,"Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million."
1721,Beatles,"James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%)."
1722,Beatles,"Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000."
1723,Beatles,"At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973."
1724,Beatles,"Harrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included ""Taxman"" and ""Within You Without You""."
1725,Beatles,"The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as ""What Goes On"" and ""Flying"", were also Northern Songs copyrights."
1726,Beatles,"Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on."
1727,Beatles,"Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and ""Something""."
1728,Beatles,"That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, ""Don't Pass Me By"" and ""Octopus's Garden""."
1729,Beatles,"In March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles."
1730,Beatles,The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.
1731,Beatles,"The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, ""I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City."""
1732,Beatles,"By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973."
1733,Beatles,"In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969."
1734,Beatles,"In 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, Associated Communications Corporation (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division."
1735,Beatles,"According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million."
1736,Beatles,"According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to ""separate off"" that portion of ATV Music."
1737,Beatles,"Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20 million, giving the ex-Beatle ""a week or so"" to decide."
1738,Beatles,"By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected."

1756,RStones,"The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar, vocals), Bill Wyman (bass guitar), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano)."
1757,RStones,Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985.
1758,RStones,"The band's primary songwriters, Jagger–Richards, assumed leadership after Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager."
1759,RStones,"Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor."
1760,RStones,Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood who has since remained.
1761,RStones,"Since Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has served as touring bassist."
1762,RStones,"The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including Jack Nitzsche (1965–1971), Nicky Hopkins (1967–1982), Billy Preston (1971–1981), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), and Chuck Leavell (1982–present)."
1763,RStones,The Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s.
1764,RStones,"Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" and ""Paint It Black"" became international hits, and Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – has been considered the most important of the band's formative records."
1765,RStones,"After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its ""bluesy"" roots with Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971), and Exile on Main St. (1972)."
1766,RStones,"It was during this period they were first introduced on stage as ""The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World""."
1767,RStones,"The band continued to release commercially successful albums through the 1970s and early 1980s, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), the two best-sellers in their discography."
1768,RStones,"During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade."
1769,RStones,"Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released Steel Wheels (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour."
1770,RStones,"Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent."
1771,RStones,"Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit."
1772,RStones,"By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang (2005–2007)."
1773,RStones,"Musicologist Robert Palmer attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being ""rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music"", while ""more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone""."
1774,RStones,The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004.
1775,RStones,"Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" list and their estimated record sales is 200 million."

1784,RStones,1 in the UK and No.
1785,RStones,4 in the US and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album.

1787,RStones,"Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became childhood friends and classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent."
1788,RStones,"The Jagger family moved to Wilmington, Kent, five miles (8.0 km) away, in 1954."
1789,RStones,"In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley."
1790,RStones,Jagger met Richards again on 17 October 1961 on platform two of Dartford railway station.
1791,RStones,The Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records Jagger was carrying revealed a shared interest.
1792,RStones,A musical partnership began shortly afterwards.
1793,RStones,Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house.
1794,RStones,The meetings moved to Taylor's house in late 1961 where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.
1795,RStones,"In March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the Ealing Jazz Club in Jazz News newspaper, which mentioned Alexis Korner's rhythm and blues band, Blues Incorporated."
1796,RStones,"The group sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was favourably impressed."
1797,RStones,"On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included slide guitarist Brian Jones, keyboardist Ian Stewart and drummer Charlie Watts."
1798,RStones,"After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group."
1799,RStones,"Jones, no longer in a band, advertised for bandmates in Jazz Weekly, while Stewart found them a practice space; together they decided to form a band playing Chicago blues."
1800,RStones,"Soon after, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart."
1801,RStones,"The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band."
1802,RStones,They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards.
1803,RStones,"In June 1962 the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart and Taylor."
1804,RStones,"According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to Jazz News."
1805,RStones,"When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was ""Rollin' Stone""."
1806,RStones,"Jones, Jagger, Richards, Stewart, and Taylor played a gig billed as ""the Rollin' Stones"" on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club in London."
1807,RStones,"Shortly afterwards, the band went on their first tour of the UK, which they called a ""training ground"" tour, because it was a new experience for all of them."
1808,RStones,Their material included the Chicago blues as well as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs.
1809,RStones,"The band's original rhythm section did not include bassist Bill Wyman, who joined in December 1962, or drummer Charlie Watts, who joined in January 1963."
1810,RStones,By 1963 they were finding their musical stride as well as popularity.
1811,RStones,"In 1964 two unscientific opinion polls rated the band as Britain's most popular group, outranking even the Beatles."
1812,RStones,"The band's name was changed shortly after their first gig to ""The Rolling Stones""."
1813,RStones,"The group's then acting manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London, in February 1963."
1814,RStones,"He claimed this triggered an ""international renaissance for the blues""."
1815,RStones,"In May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham as their manager."
1816,RStones,"His previous clients, the Beatles, directed the former publicist to the band."
1817,RStones,Because Oldham was only nineteen and had not reached the age of majority—he was also younger than anyone in the band—he could not obtain an agent's licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing.
1818,RStones,By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton to secure record financing and assistance booking venues.
1819,RStones,"Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted."
1820,RStones,"Initially, Oldham tried applying the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, and have the band members wear suits."
1821,RStones,"He later changed his mind and imagined a band which contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance."
1822,RStones,"He wanted to make the Stones ""a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables"" and to ""establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic""."
1823,RStones,"Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist."
1824,RStones,"Of Stewart's decision, Oldham later said, ""Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for  to remember the faces in the picture."""
1825,RStones,"Later, Oldham reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers."
1826,RStones,"Decca Records, which had declined to sign a deal with the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with favourable terms."
1827,RStones,"The band got three times a new act's typical royalty rate, full artistic control of recordings and ownership of the recording master tapes."
1828,RStones,The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios.
1829,RStones,"Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became their preferred location."
1830,RStones,"Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that ""leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way"" creating a ""wall of noise"" that worked well for the band."
1831,RStones,"Because of Regent's low booking rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks common at other studios."
1832,RStones,"All tracks on the first Rolling Stones album, The Rolling Stones, were recorded there."
1833,RStones,"Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in EMI's studios, saying it made them appear as ""mere mortals ... sweating in the studio for the man""."
1834,RStones,He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoint to the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of their first album.
1835,RStones,"He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as: ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?"""
1836,RStones,"By contrast, Wyman says, ""Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally."
1837,RStones,...  never did engineer it.
1838,RStones,"He simply exploited it exhaustively."""
1839,RStones,"In a 1972 interview, Wyman stated, ""We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter."""
1840,RStones,"A cover version of Chuck Berry's ""Come On"" was the Rolling Stones' first single, released on 7 June 1963."
1841,RStones,"The band refused to play it at live gigs, and Decca bought only one ad to promote the record."
1842,RStones,"With Oldham's direction, fan-club members bought copies at record shops polled by the charts, helping ""Come On"" rise to No."
1843,RStones,21 on the UK Singles Chart.
1844,RStones,"Having a charting single gave the band entree to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in Middlesbrough on 13 July, sharing the billing with the Hollies."
1845,RStones,"Later in 1963 Oldham and Easton arranged the band's first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars including Bo Diddley, Little Richard and the Everly Brothers."
1846,RStones,The tour gave the band the opportunity to hone their stagecraft.
1847,RStones,"During the tour the band recorded their second single, a Lennon–McCartney-penned number entitled ""I Wanna Be Your Man""."
1848,RStones,The song was written and given to the Stones when John Lennon and Paul McCartney visited them in the studio as the two Beatles liked giving the copyrights to songs away to their friends.
1849,RStones,It reached No.
1850,RStones,12 on the UK charts.
1851,RStones,"The Beatles 1963 album, With the Beatles, includes their version of the song."
1852,RStones,"On 1 January 1964, the Stones' ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" was the first song ever performed on the BBC's Top of the Pops."
1853,RStones,"The third single by the Stones, Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"", reflecting Bo Diddley's style, was released in February 1964 and reached No."
1854,RStones,"Oldham saw little future for an act that lost significant songwriting royalties by playing songs of what he described as ""middle-aged blacks"", limiting the appeal to teenage audiences."
1855,RStones,Jagger and Richards decided to write songs together.
1856,RStones,"Oldham described the first batch as ""soppy and imitative""."
1857,RStones,"Because the band's songwriting developed slowly, songs on their first album The Rolling Stones (1964; issued in the US as England's Newest Hit Makers), were primarily covers, with only one Jagger/Richards original—""Tell Me (You're Coming Back)""—and two numbers credited to Nanker Phelge, the pen name used for songs written by the entire group."
1858,RStones,"The Rolling Stones' first US tour in June 1964 was ""a disaster"" according to Wyman."
1859,RStones,"When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record  or anything going for us."""
1860,RStones,"When the band appeared on the variety show The Hollywood Palace, that week's guest host, Dean Martin, mocked both their hair and their performance."

1866,RStones,"According to Jagger, ""We weren't actually following James Brown because there was considerable time between the filming of each section."
1867,RStones,"Nevertheless, he was still very annoyed about it ..."" On 25 October the band appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show."
1868,RStones,"Because of the pandemonium surrounding the Stones, Sullivan banned them from his show."
1869,RStones,"However, he booked them for an appearance in the following year."
1870,RStones,"Their second LP, 12 X 5, which was only available in the US, was released during the tour."
1871,RStones,"During the early Stones' releases, Richards was typically credited as ""Richard""."
1872,RStones,"The Rolling Stones' fifth UK single, a cover of Willie Dixon's ""Little Red Rooster""—with ""Off the Hook"", credited to Nanker Phelge, as the B-side—was released in November 1964 and became their second No."

1964,RStones,The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions.
1965,RStones,"The split was publicly amicable, but in 2003 Jagger said: ""The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish."
1966,RStones,It was not a great moment really—and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either.
1967,RStones,"There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job."""
1968,RStones,Satanic Majesties became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own.

1981,RStones,There is a change between material on Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet.
1982,RStones,I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells.
1983,RStones,"Who knows where these things come from, but I guess  was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality."
1984,RStones,A spell in prison ... will certainly give you room for thought ...
1985,RStones,I was fucking pissed with being busted.
1986,RStones,"So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.'"
1987,RStones,There's a lot of anger in the music from that period.

1994,RStones,"Richards reported that in a June meeting with Jagger, Watts and himself at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to ""go on the road again"", and left the band saying, ""I've left, and if I want to I can come back."""
1995,RStones,"On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex."

2023,RStones,"The following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them a Jagger/Richards credited single."
2024,RStones,"To get back at the label and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track ""Schoolboy Blues""—deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of forcing Decca to keep it ""in the vaults""."
2025,RStones,"Amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records."
2026,RStones,"Sticky Fingers, released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover designed by Andy Warhol."

2028,RStones,"When unzipped, it revealed the subject's underwear, imprinted with a saying— ""This Is Not Etc."""
2029,RStones,In some markets an alternate cover was released because of the perceived offensive nature of the original at the time.
2030,RStones,"Sticky Fingers' cover was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band's logo."
2031,RStones,It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue.
2032,RStones,Designer John Pasche created the logo following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the out stuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali.
2033,RStones,"Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, ""Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ..."

2036,RStones,"1 Greatest Album Cover"" of all time in 2003."
2037,RStones,"The album contains one of their best-known hits, ""Brown Sugar"", and the country-influenced ""Dead Flowers""."

2043,RStones,"In 1968, the Stones, acting on a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in a van and created a mobile recording studio so they would not be limited to the standard 9–5 operating hours of most recording studios."
2044,RStones,"The band lent the mobile studio to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, who used it to record Led Zeppelin III (1970) and Led Zeppelin IV (1971)."
2045,RStones,"Deep Purple immortalised the mobile studio itself in the song ""Smoke on the Water"" with the line ""the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, making our music there""."
2046,RStones,"Following the release of Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones left England after receiving advice from their financial manager Prince Rupert Loewenstein."
2047,RStones,He recommended they go into tax exile before the start of the next financial year.
2048,RStones,"The band had learned, despite being assured that their taxes were taken care of, they had not been paid for seven years and the UK government was owed a relative fortune."
2049,RStones,"The Stones moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and their entourage."
2050,RStones,"Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement."

2052,RStones,"The resulting double album, Exile on Main St., was released in May 1972, and reached number one in both the US and the UK."
2053,RStones,Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs—who reversed his opinion within months—Exile is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums.
2054,RStones,The films Cocksucker Blues (never officially released) and Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American Tour.
2055,RStones,"The band's double compilation, Hot Rocks 1964–1971, was released in 1972; it reached No."

2061,RStones,Members of the band set up a complex financial structure in 1972 to reduce the amount of their taxes.
2062,RStones,"Their holding company, Promogroup, has offices in both The Netherlands and the Caribbean."
2063,RStones,The Netherlands was chosen because it does not directly tax royalty payments.
2064,RStones,"The band have been tax exiles ever since, meaning they can no longer use Britain as their main residence."
2065,RStones,"Due to the arrangements with the holding company, the band has reportedly paid a tax of just 1.6% on their total earnings of £242 million over the past 20 years."
2066,RStones,"In November 1972 the band began recording sessions in Kingston, Jamaica, for the album Goats Head Soup; it was released in 1973 and reached No."
2067,RStones,1 in both the UK and US.
2068,RStones,"The album, which contained the worldwide hit ""Angie"", was the first in a string of commercially successful but tepidly received studio albums."
2069,RStones,"The sessions for Goats Head Soup also produced unused material, most notably an early version of the popular ballad ""Waiting on a Friend"", which was not released until the Tattoo You LP eight years later."
2070,RStones,"Another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of Goats Head Soup."
2071,RStones,Authorities had issued a warrant for Richards' arrest and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning.
2072,RStones,"This, along with Jagger's 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, complicated the band's plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia."
2073,RStones,"A European tour followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France, coming after Richards' arrest in England on drug charges."

2077,RStones,"Miller was not invited to return as the album's album producer because his ""contribution level had dropped""."
2078,RStones,"Jagger and Richards produced the album credited as ""the Glimmer Twins""."
2079,RStones,Both the album and the single of the same name were hits.
2080,RStones,"Near the end of 1974, Taylor began to lose patience after years of feeling like a ""junior citizen in the band of jaded veterans""."
2081,RStones,"The band's situation made normal functioning complicated, with members living in different countries, and legal barriers restricting where they could tour."
2082,RStones,"In addition, drug use was starting to affect Taylor's and Richards' productivity, and Taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised."
2083,RStones,"At the end of 1974, with a recording session already booked in Munich to record another album, Taylor quit the Rolling Stones."
2084,RStones,"Taylor said in 1980,"
2085,RStones,I was getting a bit fed up.
2086,RStones,I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else ...
2087,RStones,I wasn't really composing songs or writing at that time.
2088,RStones,"I was just beginning to write, and that influenced my decision ..."
2089,RStones,There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else's success.
2090,RStones,And there are some people for whom that's not enough.
2091,RStones,It really wasn't enough for me.
2092,RStones,"The Stones needed a new guitarist, and the recording sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (1976) (No."
2093,RStones,"2 in the UK, No."
2094,RStones,1 in the US) in Munich provided an opportunity for some guitarists hoping to join the band to work while trying out.
2095,RStones,Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis.
2096,RStones,Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed they had played without realising they were being auditioned.
2097,RStones,"American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out, but Richards and Jagger preferred for the band to remain purely British."
2098,RStones,"When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed he was the right choice."
2099,RStones,"He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track ""It's Only Rock 'n Roll""."
2100,RStones,"He had declined Jagger's earlier offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to the Faces, saying ""that's what's really important to me""."
2101,RStones,Faces' lead singer Rod Stewart went so far as to say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.
2102,RStones,"Wood officially joined the Rolling Stones in 1975 for their upcoming Tour of the Americas, which was a contributing factor in the disbandment of the Faces."
2103,RStones,"Unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee, which remained the case until the early 1990s, when he finally joined the Stones' business partnership."
2104,RStones,The 1975 Tour of the Americas kicked off in New York City with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down Broadway.
2105,RStones,The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience.
2106,RStones,"Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo, a club in Toronto, to produce a long-overdue live album, 1977's Love You Live, the first Stones live album since Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!."
2107,RStones,It reached No.
2108,RStones,3 in the UK and No.
2109,RStones,5 in the US.
2110,RStones,Richards' addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already arrived.
2111,RStones,"On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue."
2112,RStones,"Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Anita Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams (0.78 oz) of heroin in Richards' room."
2113,RStones,"He was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence."
2114,RStones,The Crown prosecutor later conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after his arrival.
2115,RStones,"Despite the incident, the band played two shows in Toronto, only to cause more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show."
2116,RStones,The band's shows were not advertised to the public.
2117,RStones,"Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by April Wine for a recording session."
2118,RStones,"1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine."
2119,RStones,Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.
2120,RStones,"On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident."
2121,RStones,The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year.
2122,RStones,"Ultimately, he received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two free concerts for the CNIB in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, which Richards also joined."
2123,RStones,This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin.
2124,RStones,"It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara."
2125,RStones,Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction as Richards struggled to get clean.
2126,RStones,"While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle."
2127,RStones,"He was a regular at New York's Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall."
2128,RStones,"His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged."
2129,RStones,"Although the Rolling Stones remained popular through the early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations."
2130,RStones,"By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band."
2131,RStones,"The group's fortunes changed in 1978, after the band released Some Girls, which included the hit single ""Miss You"", the country ballad ""Far Away Eyes"", ""Beast of Burden"" and ""Shattered""."
2132,RStones,"In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly ""Respectable"", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people."
2133,RStones,It reached No.
2134,RStones,2 in the UK and No.
2135,RStones,1 in the US.

2138,RStones,"During recording sessions for the album, a rift between Jagger and Richards was slowly developing."
2139,RStones,Richards wanted to tour in the summer or autumn of 1980 to promote the new album.
2140,RStones,"Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined."
2141,RStones,Emotional Rescue hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached No.3 in the US.
2142,RStones,"In early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as rehearse for the tour."
2143,RStones,"That year's resulting album, Tattoo You, featured a number of outtakes, including lead single ""Start Me Up"", which reached No.2 in the US and ranked No.22 on Billboard's Hot 100 year-end chart."
2144,RStones,"Two songs (""Waiting on a Friend"" (US No."
2145,RStones,"13) and ""Tops"") featured Mick Taylor's unused rhythm guitar tracks, while jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins played on ""Slave"", ""Neighbours"" and ""Waiting on a Friend""."

2400,RStones,"Richards recalls, ""He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff."

2409,RStones,"Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, ""Tell Me (You're Coming Back)"", as a ""pop rock ballad ..."
2410,RStones,"When  began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers""."
2411,RStones,"""As Tears Go By"", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists."
2412,RStones,"Jagger said of the song, ""It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time."
2413,RStones,"And we didn't think of  it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group."""
2414,RStones,The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.
2415,RStones,"Of their early writing experience, Richards said,"
2416,RStones,"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts."
2417,RStones,"That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'"
2418,RStones,"Jagger said,"
2419,RStones,We were very pop-orientated.
2420,RStones,We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything.
2421,RStones,In some ways it's easy to write to order  ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes.
2422,RStones,"I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us."
2423,RStones,"The writing of ""The Last Time"", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point."
2424,RStones,"Richards called it ""a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones."
2425,RStones,"It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."""
2426,RStones,"The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones."
2427,RStones,"Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge."
2428,RStones,Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.
2429,RStones,"Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the ""ancient art of weaving"" responsible for part of their sound – the interplay between two guitarists on stage."
2430,RStones,"Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's (Watts)."
2431,RStones,"Likewise, Watts is primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming."
2432,RStones,"The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills."
2433,RStones,"In the studio, the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song."
2434,RStones,Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing.
2435,RStones,"On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four."
2436,RStones,"Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968."
2437,RStones,"Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Brown Sugar"" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), ""Tumbling Dice"" (capo IV), ""Happy"" (capo IV) (Exile on Main St., 1972), and ""Start Me Up"" (Tattoo You, 1981)."
2438,RStones,"The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years."
2439,RStones,"When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like his authority diminished."
2440,RStones,"This led to the period Richards has referred to as ""World War III""."
2441,RStones,"Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded ""by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions""."
2442,RStones,"Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, ""changed music"" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry."
2443,RStones,"Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones have survived multiple feuds."

2445,RStones,"According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time."
2446,RStones,"Their top single is ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", regarded by many at the time as ""the classic example of rock and roll""."
2447,RStones,"The Stones contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own ""codewords"" and slang, such as ""losing streak"" for menstrual period, which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs."
2448,RStones,"The band has been viewed as the musical ""vanguard of a major transfusion"" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain."
2449,RStones,Muddy Waters was quoted as saying that the Rolling Stones and other English bands piqued the interest of American youth in blues musicians.
2450,RStones,"After they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums—and those of other blues musicians—increased public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music."
2451,RStones,"The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length, including three of the highest-grossing tours of all time: Bridges to Babylon Tour, Voodoo Lounge Tour, and A Bigger Bang Tour."
2452,RStones,"In May 2013, Rolling Stone magazine declared them the ""most definitional band that rock & roll has produced""."
2453,RStones,"The Telegraph called Mick Jagger ""the Rolling Stone who changed music""."
2454,RStones,The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989.
2455,RStones,The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually.
2456,RStones,"They are also credited with changing the ""whole business model of popular music""."
2457,RStones,"The band has received, and been nominated for multiple awards during their 55 years together including: three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and NME (New Musical Express) awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary Crossfire Hurricane."
2458,RStones,"On Mick Jagger's 75th birthday, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band."
2459,RStones,"Two species, Petroperla mickjaggeri and Lapisperla keithrichardsi, were placed within a new family Petroperlidae."
2460,RStones,"The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek ""petra"" that stands for ""stone""."
2461,RStones,"The scientists referred to the fossils as ""Rolling Stoneflies""."
2462,RStones,The Rolling Stones have performed more than two thousand concerts around the world.
2463,RStones,Their first concert was on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London.
2464,RStones,The most documented of the band's concerts is the Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway in 1969.
2465,RStones,The Hells Angels biker gang provided security.
2466,RStones,"They stabbed and beat an audience member, Meredith Hunter to death."
2467,RStones,Albert and David Maysles documented part of the tour and the Altamont concert in their film Gimme Shelter.
2468,RStones,"From small clubs and hotels in London with little room for Jagger to move around to selling out stadiums worldwide, Rolling Stones tours have changed significantly over the decades."
2469,RStones,"The Stones' early setups were simple compared to what they became later in the band's career when elaborate stage designs, pyrotechnics and giant screens were used."
2470,RStones,"By the time the Stones toured America in 1969, they began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California."
2471,RStones,"They were also using more equipment, including lighting rigs and better sound equipment than they had used in clubs."
2472,RStones,"The 1969 tour is considered a ""great watershed tour"" by Mick Jagger because they ""started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights""."
2473,RStones,"Attributing the birth of arena rock to the Stones 1969 US tour, The Guardian ranked it 19 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history."
2474,RStones,"Before this tour the loudest sound at large-capacity shows was often the crowd, so the Stones used lighting and sound systems that ensured they could be seen and heard in the biggest arenas."
2475,RStones,"The Guardian commented that their ""combination of front-of-house excellence and behind the scenes savvy took the business of touring to an entirely new level."""
2476,RStones,"During the 1972 tour, the Stones developed a complex light show which included giant mirrors that bounced the light off them."
2477,RStones,"During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band, and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher."
2478,RStones,"The props the band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication, similar to those on Broadway."
2479,RStones,"They started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show."
2480,RStones,"On this tour they had two versions of what Jagger referred to as the ""lotus stage""."
2481,RStones,"One version had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain, and the other had leaves that began in a folded up position and opened during the beginning of the concert."
2482,RStones,"This period also included a variety of props, including inflatable penises and other gimmicks, and incorporated a number of circus tricks."
2483,RStones,… at the beginning of the show the stage was completely covered with a kind of sheath gauze.
2484,RStones,"I had to get inside the lotus, climb up a ladder and hang on like grim death to one of the petals, which then opened to reveal the band playing."
2485,RStones,"During the 1981–1982 American tour, the Stones worked with Japanese designer Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium-sized locations and audiences."
2486,RStones,"During this period, stages increased in size to include runways and movable sections of the stage going out into the audience."
2487,RStones,This tour used coloured panels and was one of the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens.
2488,RStones,Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band.
2489,RStones,"The venues were large enough in size that the band became ""like ants"" to audience members."
2490,RStones,"This resulted in Jagger having to project himself ""over the footlights"" and the band needing to use more gimmicks, such as pyrotechnics, lights and video screens."
2491,RStones,"When you're out there in this vast stadium, you have to physically tiny up on stage, so that's why on the 1981-2 tour we had those coloured panels and later we started using devices like video screens."
2492,RStones,"We became very aware of not being seen, of just being there like ants."
2493,RStones,Mick is the one who really has to project himself over the footlights.
2494,RStones,"And when the show gets that big, you need a little extra help, you need a couple of gimmicks, as we call it, in the show."
2495,RStones,"You need fireworks, you need lights, you need a bit of theatre."
2496,RStones,"As time went on, their props and stage equipment became increasingly sophisticated."
2497,RStones,"When the Stones began to fill stadium-sized venues, or larger, they ran into the problem of the audience no longer being able to see them."
2498,RStones,This was particularly the case when they performed a free concert for an estimated 1.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour in 2006.
2499,RStones,"The show required over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost thirteen metres (43 ft) in length."
2500,RStones,"Due to the 2.5 km (1.6 mi) length of the beach on which the Stones performed, sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern down the length of the beach, to keep the sound in sync with the music from the stage; for every three hundred and forty metres (1,120 ft) of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second."
2501,RStones,"Until Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), UK and US releases were slightly different."
